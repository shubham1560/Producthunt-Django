# producthunt
The project was made using only django framework from frontend to backend which is easier to maintain if the website's structure is not too large, otherwise the front end and back end would have been different

There are several features like commenting on the product, upvoting the product and an upvote is once per user and also if the user found it useful,
the repo gives an idea that a full fledged website can be made in django, but it won't be that good as there are many things which can be handled 
on the client side, that we have to send to our server for validation like password matching
